## Execution order



1. FROM/JOIN
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. DISTINCT
7. ORDER BY
8. LIMIT/OFFSET

## Syntax order

Note that the syntax order are different than the execution order 

1. SELECT
2. FROM
3. JOIN 
4. WHERE 
5. GROUP BY 
6. HAVING 
7. ORDER BY 
8. LIMIT 

However in duckdb actually, there is FROM-first syntax, where the FROM clause comes before SELECT clause.
