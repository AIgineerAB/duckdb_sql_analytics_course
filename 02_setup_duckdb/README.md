## Setup

Follow [this link to install duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=cli&platform=macos&download_method=package_manager) on your computer.

<details>
  <summary><b>Mac</b></summary>
  ```bash
  curl https://install.duckdb.org | sh
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

Click direct download and unzip so you get the .exe file. Copy the .exe file and go to your programs folder, create a new folder called duckdb and paste the .exe file there. Then add the path to your environment variables so that you can run duckdb from anywhere in the terminal.

To add environment variable, you should go into system properties &gt; advanced &gt; environment variables &gt; under system variables find path &gt; edit &gt; new &gt; add the path to the duckdb folder you created &gt; ok &gt; ok &gt; ok.

Now go into git bash and run

```bash
duckdb --version
```

to see if it worked.

## Bash commands

If you are in windows use git bash, if you are in mac or linux just use the terminal. In visual studio code open up a terminal then you can set the default profile of your terminal to open up in git bash

To navigate using bash you have these commands

| Command | Description                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cd`    | change the current directory             |
| `cd ..` | go up a directory                        |
| `ls`    | list the contents of a directory         |
| `ls -a` | lists all files including hidden files   |
| `pwd`   | print the current working directory path |
| `<`     | input redirection                        |

> [!NOTE]
> There are many more bash commands, but we'll just cover the most basic ones here so that you can navigate in the computer without a GUI.

## Duckdb CLI

To check that it works, lets go to the terminal, navigate to your local repository and run the following command

```bash
duckdb test_yt.duckdb
```

By doing this it creates a persistent or a file-backed database that is saved on disk when you run any commands. So lets run a few commands

```sql
-- describes structures of database objects
desc;

-- query metadata about the database
SELECT * FROM information_schema.schemata;
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;
```

To close down the database connection do `ctrl + D` for mac and `ctrl + C` for windows in the terminal.

## Ingest data

Now we'll ingest data from a csv file into our test.duckdb. So start by opening up a connection to your database file

```bash
duckdb test_yt.duckdb
```

Then to ingest the data into the database run

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
  videos AS (
    SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('yt_videos.csv')
    );
```

Finally we'll check that the data is there by selecting all the columns (wildcard selection)

```sql
SELECT * FROM videos;
```

Now close down the database connection and open it up again, then do wildcard selection once more and test out `desc` as well to see that the data is persistent. Close down the database connection, git commit your changes and push it to github.

## Meta commands

In duckdb CLI you could read the data directly from a SQL script by doing a input redirection

```bash
duckdb test_yt.duckdb < ingest_data.sql
```

where the SQL commands for ingesting the data is in the file ingest_data.sql and placed in the same directory. This sends the content from ingest_data.sql into duckdb test_yt.duckdb as an argument, which makes it run the code.

Another way is to use a meta command once you've started a duckdb session you can do `.read ingest_data.sql` to run it. Meta commands or dot commands in duckdb starts with a . and are used to perform variopus administrative and informational tasks in duckdb CLI.

Some other common meta commands

| Meta Command | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `.open`      | Opens a DuckDB database file.                |
| `.read`      | Executes SQL commands from a specified file. |
| `.schema`    | Shows the schema of tables in the database.  |
| `.tables`    | Lists all tables in the connected database.  |
| `.quit`      | Exits the DuckDB CLI.                        |
| `.help`      | Lists all available meta commands.           |

## Gitignore

Add these to your gitignore to instruct git not to track the .wal file of duckdb

```bash
*.wal
```

Also if you are on a mac you can should also add this to your gitignore

```bash
*.DS_Store
```
